# Django Code of Conduct

## Report handling procedure

This document aims to present the way we handle received reports. This is not a complete guide, but a set of guidelines or best practices that guide the way we provide support to the community. Each issue is different and requires individual consideration on a case-to-case basis.

### Types of received reports

In general, almost all reports we receive can be categorized into two groups:

- **reported by local representatives** - issues that were usually already handled by organizers or curators of communities like Django conferences, meetups or online spaces like IRC and subreddits. In those situations, we either acknowledge the report if it was already resolved and keep it in our central log, or provide support and advice, or enforce Code of Conduct if needed.
- **reported by people who need our help** - those reports usually require our decision and enforcement of the Code of Conduct. 

### How we receive reports

All reports received by us are usually sent to [conduct@djangoproject.com](mailto:conduct@djangoproject.com) email address that is automatically forwarded to each member of the committee.

We're looking into more ways to make it as easy for people as possible to report an issue. Feedback on that matter would be throughly appreciated.

### On-call duty

In order to achieve a fast response time to received reports, we implement a week long on-call duty. Every week we assign one member of the Code of Conduct committee to be the primary person on duty, and another member to be a secondary supporter. On-call duty ends and finishes every Monday at noon UTC, when a reminder is sent to conduct@djangoproject.com with information who is the next primary and secondary member on-duty following week. Schedule is managed via spreadsheet. If a member won't be available on given week, they should exchange their week with another member.

![Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/sitarska.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B_sMcBckSgWqX1p5cm50UmQ1VVk)

**Primary person on duty** is responsible for providing the initial response to a reporter, ideally within half a day. They're also responsible for either shepherding the received issue, or finding another member of the committee who will commit to shepherding it.

**Secondary person on duty** inherits the responsibilities of the primary person if they're not available.

If all else fails, any member of the committee can step in and pick up an issue if they see that response hasn't been provided within a first day. 

### Initial response

We aim to provide the initial response and acknowledgement of the received report ideally within couple of hours, or half a day. 

If the response requires decision, we should send an acknowledgement of the report to make sure the report is informed we're working on it, and not ignoring it: 

> Hi X,

> Thanks for getting in touch and reporting the issue to the Code of Conduct, we do appreciate it. We will discuss and get back to you. 

> In the meantime, if there is anything we can do *immediately* to help you, please let us know. 

> Regards,  
> First Last name  
> DSF Code of Conduct

If received report clearly states that the action has been taken already, and the issue is only reported to be kept on file in our central log, the committee can close the issue by sending a simple acknowledgement:

> Hi X,

> Thanks for getting in touch and reporting the issue to the Code of Conduct, we do appreciate it. We agree with the steps you took so far, and would like to thank you for handling the issue with care. 

> We're going to keep this report on file to look for patterns in the future. 

> If there is anything else we can do to help or support you, please do let us know.

> Thank you again!

> Regards,  
> First Last name  
> DSF Code of Conduct

### Resolving the report

We aim to resolve any report received within a week.

> TODO: Issue #7 Add information about shepherding the issue
> TODO: Issue #7 Add information about decision making process
> TODO: Issue #7 Add link to Enforcement Manual for a list of available sanctions

### Closing checklist

> TODO: Issue #8

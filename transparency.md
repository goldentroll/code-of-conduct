## Code of Conduct transparency

The Code of Conduct committee aims to be transparent with the wider community 
about the work we do, the way we do it, and the outcomes. We help to protect 
the people who trust us in maintaining the confidentiality of reported issues.

There are several ways in which we are transparent right now:

- **Publishing documentation**  
  We believe that publishing documentation about the way we work in the form of this document
  keeps us accountable and allows the Django community to have a 
  an insight into the processes guiding our decisions, as well as suggest changes
  and improvements.
  
- **Publishing statistics**  
  Numbers of received reports and actions taken are published in the [statistics
  chapter](statistics.md) of this documentation to shed a light on volume of 
  issues that the committee deals with. 
  
- **Quaterly transparency report**  
  Every 3 months, a transparency report with anonymized summaries of received 
  reports is added to this documentation. 

We welcome suggestions on improving the transparency of the committee.

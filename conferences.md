# Django Code of Conduct

## Support for conference organizers

> Work in progress

- Information on how can we help conferences be more safe

The Django Code of Conduct is dedicated to providing a safe, harassment free environment for all Django conferences and meet ups.

As a conference organizer, it's best that you set up a code of conduct committee that will handle any Code of Conduct violations at the conference.
It's very important that your attendees feel protected at your conference.

The Django code of Conduct offers help to conference organizers to ensure safe environments at conferences.

### Before the conference

* We advise that you share the list of attendees with us such that we are able to check it against our list of Code of Conduct offenders. If any of the attendees appears on our list, we will let you know, and advise you on the next steps you could take.

* If you have any trouble with setting up a Code Of Conduct policy for your conference, reach out to us and we will be able to help you through the process of creating one

### During the conference

* If you encounter a code of conduct violation at your conference, that needs to be addressed immediately, you can reach out to us and we will be able to help you through the processing of resolving it.

### After the conference

* After the conference, you can reach out to us to report any Code Of Conduct violations. If you'd like us to take action on any of them, we will be able to help out. However, if no action is needed, we will add them to our records as well for future reference.

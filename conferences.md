# Django Code of Conduct

## Support for event organizers

The Django Code of Conduct is committed to providing a safe, harassment free environment for all Django events.

As an event organizer, it's best that you set up a Code of Conduct committee that will handle any Code of Conduct violations at the event.
It's very important that your attendees feel and are protected at your event.

Establishing and enforcing Code of Conduct at events is not easy. Here is how Django Code of Conduct committee can help event organizers to ensure safe environments at events.

### Before the event

* We advise that you share the list of attendees with us such that we are able to check it against our list of Code of Conduct offenders. If any of the attendees appears on our list as flagged or blacklisted, we will inform you about this.

* If you have any trouble with setting up a Code of Conduct policy for your event, reach out to us and we will be able to help you through the process of creating one.

### During the event

* If you encounter a Code of Conduct violation at your event that needs to be addressed immediately, you can reach out to us and we will be able to help you through the processing of resolving it.

### After the event

* After the event, you can reach out to us to report any Code of Conduct violations. If you'd like us to take action on any of them, we will be able to help out. However, if no action is needed, we will add them to our records as well for future reference. Reporting any (even resolved) Code of Conduct violations to us helps us create one, central record of incidents to help all events be more safe.
